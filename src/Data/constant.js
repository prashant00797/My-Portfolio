  PERSONAL_INFO_GREETINGS: `Hello Everyone!! First of thank you for visiting my page and willing to know about me. So lets get started!!!`,

  PERSONAL_INFO_ACADEMIC: `Born and raised in Itanagar, Arunachal Pradesh, India 👶, I attended Kendriya Vidyalaya No.2 for my schooling. Achieving a perfect CGPA of 10/10 in my 10th grade and securing 82.2% in my 12th grade with a Science background, I laid a strong foundation for my academic journey 🧑‍🎓.

My pursuit of higher education led me to Shillong, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2020, attaining a CGPA of 8.25/10. Following my graduation, I embarked on a professional journey that saw me contributing to both Cognizant and a product engineering startup, Avizva Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I honed my skills in various aspects of technology and project management 🧑‍🔬.

Driven by a keen interest in Agile methodologies, I undertook the Certified Scrum Master (CSM®) certification to enhance my expertise in this field. Currently, my tech stack includes proficiency in HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Webpack, as well as Agile Web Development and Scrum framework. I am deeply familiar with Agile methodologies and consistently strive to expand my knowledge base, always dedicating myself to the continuous improvement of both my skills and the organizations I serve.🧑‍💻`,
